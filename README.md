## Hisona App

Hisona is a cross platform app that makes it possible for people to have a conversation with historical artefacts like public landmarks, monuments and pieces inside museums.

The purpose of Hisona is to make learning about history easier and more fun. By leveraging AI technolohies Hisona makes the history around us more accessible, engaging and a two-way conversational experience to bring historical artefacts to 'life'.
